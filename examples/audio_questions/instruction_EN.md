You are given a set of assignments. Each assignment consists of:

 1. an audio recording
 2. a transcript of the audio recording (optional)
 3. a question and several choices of answers

For example: "listen to both audio recordings and tell me if the same person is speaking or different people?"

Your task is to listen to both audio recordings, read the text, if any, and choose the correct answer to the question asked.
