Look at photo and choose one of the options:

- **doggie** – if dog is on the photo
- **kitty** – if cat is on the photo
- **other** – if there is another animal in the photo, several animals, or no animals at all

If the photo is of poor quality and you are not sure about the choice, specify the option **other**.
