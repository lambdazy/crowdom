# Instructions for speech quality evaluation

## Introduction

Your task is to evaluate the subjective quality of the speech from short (4-5 second) audio files. Each assignment can be completed in 90 seconds.

## Instructions

You will hear samples of computer generated speech created using different methods. The purpose of this test is to evaluate the quality of each file, so that we (the researchers) can compare the methods and know which ones sound better to a general audience.

Each file should be given a score according to the following scale, known as the MOS (mean opinion score) scale for naturalness:




| **Score** | **Quality of the Speech** | **Naturalness**               |
|:---------:|:--------------------------|:------------------------------|
|     1     | Bad                       | Completely unnatural          |
|     2     | Poor                      | Mostly unnatural              |
|     3     | Fair                      | Equally natural and unnatural |
|     4     | Good                      | Mostly natural                |
|     5     | Excellent                 | Completely natural            |


## Approval/Rejection Policy

To obtain accurate results, we strongly recommend that you wear headphones and work in a quiet environment, otherwise you might not be able to discriminate between files with clearly different features.

Your results will be collected and evaluated for consistency. We (the requesters) have an estimate of each file's subjective quality that conforms with the references above. Thus, we can detect if someone submits random scores or does not rate according to these instructions, which can lead to work being rejected. You can rest assured that your work will be approved if you rate according to the instructions above.
