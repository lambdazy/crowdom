# Crowdom

__Crowdom__ is a tool for simplifying data labeling.

Write plain Python code and launch data labeling without knowledge of crowdsourcing and underlying platform
(Crowdom uses [Toloka](https://toloka.ai) as a platform for publishing tasks for workers). Define task you solve and
load source data with few lines of code, choose quality-cost-speed tradeoff in interactive UI form, launch data
labeling, study result labeling in Pandas dataframes.

## Quickstart

We recommend you to look first at [image classification](https://nbviewer.org/github/lambdazy/crowdom/blob/main/examples/image_classification/image_classification.html)
example, since it demonstrates full data labeling workflow, proposed in Crowdom, with detailed explanations for each step.

In other [examples](#Examples), you can see how working with data labeling looks like for different types of tasks with
use of Crowdom.

task with us.

## Types of tasks

Tasks in Crowdom are divided into two types:
- _Classification tasks_, which have a fixed set of labels as output.
- _Annotation tasks_, for which output has "unlimited" dimension.

In a typical _classification_ task, worker is proposed to make a choice of one of the pre-determined options.
_Side-by-side_ (SbS) comparison is a special case of _classification_ task.

As for _annotation_ task, there may be many potential solutions, and there may be more than one correct one.
_Speech transcription_, _image annotation_ are examples of annotation tasks.

## Examples

The following table contains list of examples, which demonstrates data labeling for different types of tasks, as well
as other aspects of data labeling workflow.

Examples are presented as `.ipynb` files, located in this repository, but displayed by [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/lambdazy/crowdom/tree/main/examples/),
which do it more precisely than GitHub.

_Image classification_ and _audio transcript_) examples also have `.html` versions. These examples present full
labeling workflow, corresponding two _classification_ and _annotation_ types of  tasks respectively. `.html` allows
to collapse optional sections in notebook to simplify understanding of main steps of workflow,  as well as to display
interactive widgets contents (for example, to display quality-cost-speed tradeoff interactive form).
